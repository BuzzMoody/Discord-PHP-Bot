This project is a Discord PHP bot running on the DiscordPHP codebase. It uses written commands (no slash commands) that are distributed in the Commands folder.


This is a hobby project that I run on a RaspberryPi 5. No guarantees given it will even run for you. Feel free to submit your own code :)
